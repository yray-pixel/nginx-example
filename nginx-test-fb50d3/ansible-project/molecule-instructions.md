# Molecule Testing Instructions

## Overview

This project includes [Molecule](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/)
tests for validating the generated Ansible roles. The tests run inside an
Execution Environment (EE) container on AAP and verify that each role produces
the expected filesystem state.

## Prerequisites

### 1. x2a Execution Environment (EE)

The x2a EE is used for both molecule tests and running migrated roles on AAP.
It extends the base Ansible EE with `molecule` and `kubernetes` Python packages.
The x2a convertor ships a ready-to-build EE definition in `ee-x2a/`.

**Build and push the EE image:**

```bash
cd ee-x2a
podman build -t <your-registry>/ee-x2a:latest -f Containerfile .
podman push <your-registry>/ee-x2a:latest
```

**Configure x2a to use your EE image:**

```bash
export AAP_EE_IMAGE=<your-registry>/ee-x2a:latest
```

The `publish-aap` command will automatically register the EE on AAP.

### 2. AAP Cluster: Shared Receptor Data Directory

AAP's receptor process (in the `aap-controller-ee` container) writes work unit
results to `/tmp/receptor/`. The task container must be able to read these
results. By default each container has its own `/tmp`, so a shared volume is
required.

**Patch the AutomationController CR** (one-time cluster setup):

```bash
oc patch automationcontroller <your-controller-name> -n <namespace> --type=merge -p '{
  "spec": {
    "extra_volumes": "- name: receptor-data\n  emptyDir: {}\n",
    "ee_extra_volume_mounts": "- name: receptor-data\n  mountPath: /tmp/receptor\n",
    "task_extra_volume_mounts": "- name: receptor-data\n  mountPath: /tmp/receptor\n"
  }
}'
```

Without this, project syncs will fail with:
`Failed to JSON parse a line from worker stream`

### 3. AAP Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AAP_CONTROLLER_URL` | Yes | AAP Controller base URL |
| `AAP_ORG_NAME` | Yes | AAP organization name |
| `AAP_USERNAME` + `AAP_PASSWORD` | Yes* | Basic auth credentials |
| `AAP_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Yes* | Alternative: OAuth token |
| `AAP_EE_IMAGE` | Yes | x2a EE container image URL |
| `AAP_VERIFY_SSL` | No | Set `false` for self-signed certs |
| `AAP_SCM_CREDENTIAL_ID` | No | Credential ID for private git repos |

\* One of basic auth or OAuth token is required.

## Available Molecule Job Templates

- **Molecule — nginx** — tests the `nginx` role

## How to Launch from the AAP UI

1. Log in to the AAP Controller web interface.
2. Navigate to **Resources → Templates**.
3. Find the template named **Molecule — <role_name>**.
4. Click the **Launch** (rocket) button.
   - The template is pre-configured with the correct inventory, execution
     environment, and playbook — no additional settings are needed.
5. Monitor the job output. A successful run shows all Molecule phases passing:
   - **dependency** — resolves role/collection dependencies
   - **syntax** — validates playbook syntax
   - **create** — provisions the test instance (no-op for delegated driver)
   - **converge** — creates expected filesystem state under `/tmp/molecule_test/`
   - **idempotence** — re-runs converge to confirm no changes
   - **verify** — asserts expected files and directories exist
   - **destroy** — cleans up (no-op for delegated driver)

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `Failed to JSON parse a line from worker stream` | `/tmp/receptor` not shared between containers | Apply the receptor volume patch above |
| converge fails with "permission denied" | Paths outside `/tmp/` | All test paths must use `/tmp/molecule_test/` prefix |
| verify fails with "file does not exist" | Mismatch between converge and verify paths | Ensure verify checks the same `/tmp/molecule_test/` paths that converge creates |
| "sudo: command not found" | `become: true` in molecule playbook | Remove all `become: true` — the EE container has no sudo |
| Project sync error on first launch | Receptor timing issue | Re-launch the job — `scm_update_on_launch` triggers a fresh sync |
